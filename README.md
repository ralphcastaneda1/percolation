Percolation

**Estimate the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation**  

## Overview

A percolation system is modeled on an $N\times N$ grid of sites.  Each site is either **open** or **blocked**; a site is **full** if itâ€™s open and connected to the top row via neighboring open sites.  The system **percolates** if any site in the bottom row becomes full.
